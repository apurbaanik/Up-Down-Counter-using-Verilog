# Up-Down-Counter-using-Verilog
About developing Verilog modules for three up/down counters - binary (3 bit), Gray Code (3 bit) and One-Hot (8 bit). Counter is a special type of finite state machine that traverses through states within a state diagram circling around all states. This circling around allows a special type of output topology called state-encoded-outputs and states can be associated with the counter output value because each state in the counter represents a unique counter. In addition, the current state code can be used as the output of the entire system. In this lab we will focus on binary, gray code and one-hot counter. In a binary counter, the input determines if the counter increments or decrements by changing its states.
